# 2. Implement as Java

Date: 21.07.2017

## Status

Accepted

* Superseded by [ADR 8](0008-use-java-lts-versions.md)

## Context

ADRS need to be created on a wide variety of operating systems.

## Decision

The tool is written in Java 8 and uses the operating system independence of the Java platform.

## Consequences

As Java is not a scripting language, the code will be more complex.
